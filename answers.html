      <dt>Have I ever lived on wheels?</dt>

      <dd>I lived in a 1987 Volkswagen camper van with my boyfriend from June 2015 until January 2017. We travelled around the perimeter of the United States. It was an incredible experience, but I am happy to be settling down in Portland for awhile.</dd>


      <dt>Do I love potatoes?</dt>

      <dd>My ancestors migrated to the United States during the great potato famine around 1850. It was a rough time for them... but potatoes are DELICIOUS. I do love them.</dd>
