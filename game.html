    <h3>Game About Me</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Have I ever lived on wheels?</dt>

      <dd>I lived in a 1987 Volkswagen camper van with my boyfriend from June 2015 until January 2017. We travelled around the perimeter of the United States. It was an incredible experience, but I am happy to be settling down in Portland for awhile.</dd>


      <dt>Do I love potatoes?</dt>

      <dd>My ancestors migrated to the United States during the great potato famine around 1850. It was a rough time for them... but potatoes are DELICIOUS. I do love them.</dd>

      <dt>Do I often pet cats?</dt>

      <dd>I often meander around Portland, looking for cats to pet.</dd>

      <dt>Do I have any siblings?</dt>

      <dd>I am the youngest of 5 kids.</dd>

      <dt>Is computer programming my second career?</dt>

      <dd>My first career was as a dancer. After college I danced professionally in modern dance companies in New York City, then was a professor of dance at Northern Illinois University. I see a lot of similarities between dance and programming, actually!</dd>

      <dt>Guess a number 1 to 100.</dt>

      <dd>37</dd>

      <dt>Guess where I have lived, besides Portland!</dt>

      <dd>Kansas</dd>
      <dd>Chicago</dd>
      <dd>New York City</dd>
      <dd>Los Angeles</dd>
