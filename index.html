  <p>
    Morgan is a Portland-based choreographer and web developer. Her choreography has been shown in Chicago and New York City. Her traveling choreographic series, <a href="http://instagram.com/explore/tags/roadtripdance">#RoadTripDance</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/explore/tags/spacesuitdance">#SpaceSuitDance</a>, have taken place across the United States and can be found on Instagram. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Her choreographic focus has shifted from stage to site-specific work. While living in Los Angeles, the multitude of outdoor open spaces begged to be utilized for movement. She sees her site-specific creations as a reclamation of space that is especially important for women who are overwhelmingly socialized to take up less. She looks forward to continuing her exploration of Portland's parks and hidden places. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Morgan finds many parallels between choreography and web development and is eager to continue making connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    When she is not creating movement or learning to program, she can be found in ballet class, petting Portland cats and recruiting people into her girl gang.
